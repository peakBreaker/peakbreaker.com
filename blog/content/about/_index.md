_As a human being, I am full of biases. I find myself often wrong, and oftentimes worrying about things out of my reach. The older I get, the more I am reaching the conclusion that I know very little about this world - and I am a very lucky person indeed if I can really be sure of anything._

### My story

<br>
 I started out from a middleclass background in Norwegian society - though a bit outside the major urban and mainstream culture - from a small place called "Hole kommune". From my childhool I found myself mesmerized over technology - bugging my parents in the middle of the night because I was disassembling radios, or taking apart their phone. Naturally I would find myself in university studying mechatronics - the field of mechanics and electronics working together to create cool machines. I also had fun being in the student organization such as the student bar and student parliament.

During my studies, I found my passions drifting towards taming the complexity  of software and the entrepreneuiral scene and the machinery of policy. Fresh out of university I tried getting elected as major of my home municipality and  I crowdfunded a zero waste grocery with thse nice people.

Somehow I find myself later programming C and the telecommunications codebase  of a startup in Bergen, Norway (yes, its the city with all the rain). The goal is to build an IoT product one can put in boats to make the boat smart - Possibly saving lives along with improving efficiency #smartinfrastructure

<br>

I later carry out the development of embedded C drivers for their product aswell. To test the devices - I collect data and build datasets for the product, only to push myself towards the field of data.

These days I find myself in Amedia Utvikling AS, being brought to the company as a Data Engineer - where I really get to challenge myself in how to create technology to handle big data. I even met Jesse Anderson on an OReilly conference (Yes, I was a bit nervous - huge fan)
