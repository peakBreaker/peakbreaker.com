## Hello and welcome to my blog

Your data has value. I will help you realize this value. I believe this value is realized when your data science effort reaches production, and I will be your guy on reaching production.

This is my personal blog site. I often like to write when I am working through things, and I will post some thoughts here from time to time. I encourage you to take a look around, and I sincerely welcome feedback and criticism - its the best way to learn!
